I'm Ignacio Aguirre

I'm a Computer Science student and front-end developer based in Houston, TX. I enjoy turning ideas into responsive, usable websites using clean code and modern tools.

Skills: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), SCSS, jQuery, Git, and React JS

I focus on building interfaces that are not only functional but also fast, clean, and mobile-friendly.

Always learning. Always building.
